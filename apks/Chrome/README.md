# android_packages_apps_Jelly-prebuilt
Jelly (unsigned) apk as prebuilt from LineageOS/packages_apps_Jelly (Copyright (C) 2017 The LineageOS Project)

This is from **cm13-microG/android_packages_apps_Jelly**, which is a fork from **LineageOS/android_packages_apps_Jelly** 
(cm-14.1 branch), the unsigned APK has been built by the command *'gradlew assembleRelease'* within that repo
and uploaded here. 

The apk file can't be directly side loaded and installed, it will be included 
and signed during the build process. 

**The purpose of this repository is the use of Jelly in cm-13.0 builds**
